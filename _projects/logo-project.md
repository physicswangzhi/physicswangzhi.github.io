Non-locality is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics. A basic route for
study this non-locality is the generation of the non-local entangled electron
pairs. This project will build physical models to study the non-local entangled
electron pairs based on Cooper pair splitting effect. On top of that, we will
theoretically study the generation, protection, and detection of the non-local
entanglement. The detailed studies include four parts: (1) the quantum pumping
mechanism for the controllable generation of a singe non-local entangled electron
pair; (2) the topological protection of the non-local entanglement by the
superconducting gap. The applicant is an expert in the field of Cooper pair
splitting and non-local entanglement. The success of the project will clarify the
mechanism of generation non-local entangled electron pairs in superconductors, and
will be helpful for the fundamental research of quantum theory and the design of
superconducting quantum devices.
